## Process
Began the project by first outlining the HTML into the various sections. Used CSS/Flexbox to frame all the design at first and then full completed design once all the HTML was in place and correct. Used JavaScript to pull the quote with the API provided by Forismatic and created a Heroku CORS proxy. Adjusted output for unknown authors and long quotes. Used twitter intent to allow users to tweet quotes. Connected both "New Quote" and "Tweet" buttons to event listeners. Lastly applied animation onto buttons, a loader, and finalized design.

## Tools Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Google Fonts
* Cool Backgrounds

## What I Learned
First major application of JavaScript and Async functions as well as API implementation was a great learning experience for a somewhat practical product. Learned about CORs when requesting information for the Forismatic API and further improvements on my HTML and CSS abilities.
